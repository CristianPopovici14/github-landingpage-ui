## About

GitHub landing page UI is a project where I try to remake the GitHub landing page UI with only HTML, CSS and JS. 

## Why

I'm doing this project to improve my HTML, CSS and JS skills. I could just use frameworks to facilitate it but I just want to learn with this project. And maybe it could be a project for a portfolio.
